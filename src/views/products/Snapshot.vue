        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            The database snapshot is a complete dump of everything we know about every Crossref DOI that exists.
        </p>
        <p>
            The structure is very simple: it's a
            <a href="http://jsonlines.org/">JSON Lines</a> text file, with one line for every Crossref DOI. Each line uses the same <router-link to="/data-format">schema</router-link> as our <router-link to="/products/api">REST API,</router-link> so you can think of it as a real efficient way of calling the API for every Crossref DOI that exists, without the unpleasantness of making 100 million HTTP calls.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Versions
        </h2>
        <p>
            We release a new snapshot about twice a year. If you want more up-to-date data, it works well to pair the snapshot with ongoing diffs, available via our <router-link to="/products/data-feed">Data Feed</router-link> product.
        </p>

            Size

        <p>
            The latest version of the snapshot file is about 25GB (130G unzipped), and contains over 120 million lines.
